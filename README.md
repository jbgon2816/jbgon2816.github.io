During the year 2020, the fifth graders of Saint Augustine school, were playing and intense match of poker.
One kid by the name of Jesus Emiliano Lopez, got a little too excited and slammed his hand down and 
squished a pack of chick fil a sauce. The packet immediatly exploted and the sauce shot up and stuck to the roof.
